# Career Development

## Engineering

There are multiple levels for engineering roles. These are assigned on hiring
and periodically reviewed by managers to check that the level is still
appropriate or if a promotion is warranted. Any employee can ask for a review of
their level, but these happen periodically anyway even when the employee does
not ask for it.

According to our [wage policy](wage_policy.md), each of these levels have a
fixed salary that is the same for everyone in the same
[team](engineering-teams.md) and level, with two exceptions 1) roles that have,
inherently, a single member 2) the role of Distinguished Engineer. Salaries are updated whenever a promotion happens.

### Individual Contributor

Individual contributors are essentially all engineers that do not exercise any
kind of management activity. They are divided in levels where promotions happen
based on each engineer merits without a limit of people being at any level.

#### Intern

Interns have fixed-time contracts to work on a given team or project. They are
expected to be learning intensively and their performance is reviewed at the end
of their term to decide if they get an offer to become permanent part of the
team, usually as Junior Engineers.

#### Junior Engineer

Junior Engineers are expected to be able to work autonomously on small tasks,
fix any bug in a codebase they are already familiar with and even take ownership
of the maintenance of small projects.

Juniors will usually be promoted from internships or hired at the end of their studies.

ML extra: Junior Engineers should have basic experience of applying ML algorithms.
Besides, they should be able to obtain superficial understanding of the papers.

#### Engineer I

Engineers (I) are able to work comfortably on small tasks without any supervision, they have 
succeeded working on mid/big size tasks and are able to understand the impact of their
changes.

ML extra: Engineers (I) should already have certain scientific preferences.
There should be an intuition of which ML algorithms work best in each case.

#### Engineer II

Engineers (II) are expected to work autonomously on most tasks, create projects from
scratch and be involved actively in design of new features.

ML extra: Engineers (II) should obtain an in-depth understanding of the read papers
and efficiently implement ML algorithms from them.
They are also expected to suggest improvements to the internal processes. 

#### Engineer III

Engineers (III) are expected to work autonomously on any tasks, as well are expected to
be able to mentor other team members in small/mid tasks.

#### Senior Engineer I

Senior Engineers (I) should be able to lead the design of full features, create
and maintain any project. A Senior Engineer is expected to have significant
specialized expertise in some areas, as well as be able to comply with high
quality standards when coding. Senior Engineers are also expected to mentor
other team members as needed.

ML extra: Senior Engineer (I) should be able to suggest and develop new ML algorithms and write new papers.

#### Senior Engineer II

Senior Engineers (II) have outstanding performance and higher expertise in some important areas.

ML extra: Senior Engineers (II) should have a track of remarkable ML achievements such as
a series of successful projects at work, a recognized ML speaker profile,
high rank on Kaggle, good papers or being an author of a popular ML library.

#### Distinguished Engineer

Distinguished Engineer is reserved for Senior Engineers with outstanding expertise in a
strategic area, where they provide mentorship and decision-making advice. It is
the highest level for individual contributor roles and should be awarded with great care.

### Management

Management roles in engineering have similar expectations as individual
contributor roles in terms of engineering skills. They, however, imply managing
a team or participate intensively in higher-level decision-making processes.

Due to the nature of these roles, they are obviously limited in number, so
promotion is not automatically available on reviews and depends on the opening
of a new position.

#### Team Lead

A Team Lead is equivalent to Senior Engineer II who also manages a small team of
engineers (less than 10 people). A Team Lead is expected to be able to plan
current and future work, provide mentorship, overseeing progress of the team
and, in general, be able to make day-to-day work smooth for everyone in the team. 
A Team Lead has also a major role in the hiring process (screening, initial calls, 
code challenge reviews, etc).

#### Head of Architecture

The Head of Architecture provides decision-making inputs on technical issues
that span across wide areas, as well as mentor, implement and steer development
practices improvements.

#### Chief Technology Officer

The CTO is ultimately responsible of running the engineering department and
provide global direction on the development.
